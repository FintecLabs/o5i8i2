### Binary Stickers
**First known sighting : 24 April 2018**

Multiple stickers containing a sequence of binary strings were placed around campus.
The o5i8i2 logo (see image below) appears above the text. All the stickers seem to 
contain exactly the same numbers. Converting the values to ascii yields the following 
link: [`bit.ly/2IJOvaz`](http://bit.ly/2IJOvaz)

Stickers were found at:
+ CS Honours Lab
+ Direction sign in front of Visual Arts building
+ Neelsie top floor wall socket
+ Neelsie bottom floor supply cupboard (inside)
+ Engineering Building (many many many)



<!-- LOCATION WEBSITE -->


### Location website
The link leads to [`https://osiris-loacation.herokuapp.com`](https://osiris-loacation.herokuapp.com). 
I have made the assumption that the incorrect spelling of "location" is just an innocent mistake. 
The website contains only the o5i8i2 logo and the following text : 

> Hello...
> You know what you're looking for:
> -33.931442, 18.864543
> OR
> -33.938889, 18,860970

Interestingly, the title of the page is "o5i8i2 says hello". This is the first time we
encounter the name. It was not immediately obvious to me, but o5i8i2 is leet for 
"Osiris".



<!-- COORDINATES -->



### Coordinates
The coordinates point to 
[Dorp Street](https://www.google.com/maps/place/33%C2%B055'53.2%22S+18%C2%B051'52.4%22E/@-33.931442,18.864543,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d-33.931442!4d18.864543) 
and [Joubert Street](https://www.google.com/maps/place/33%C2%B055'53.2%22S+18%C2%B051'52.4%22E/@-33.931442,18.864543,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d-33.931442!4d18.864543) 
respectively.
The following clues were found there:

##### Dorp Street
<img alt="Dorp" src="images/dorp_st.jpg" width="400">

Converting the binary string to ascii, we get:
> Recruiting: all potential agents willing and able-minded to help fight for our cause. If interested, contact Zero-Five-One-Eight-One-Two at: 
> http://bit.ly/2IJOvaz

which leads to [`o5i8i2.herokuapp.com`](https://o5i8i2.herokuapp.com).

##### Joubert Street
<img src="images/reddit_glow.jpg" width="400" alt="Joubert">

Scanning the QR code, we get a url which leads to [`o5i8i2.herokuapp.com`](https://o5i8i2.herokuapp.com).


**Sidenote:** *Both of these clues were posted on Reddit, 
([Dorp](https://www.reddit.com/r/southafrica/comments/8ej13k/saw_the_stellenbosch_post_about_the_weird_glowing/), 
[Joubert](https://www.reddit.com/r/southafrica/comments/8e18sp/stellies_redditors_saw_this_on_joubert_str_last/)). Interestingly, the original
poster of the Joubert Street clue , `/u/RansackTheCity`, only created an account on 
March 16 2018 - roughly one month before the challenge began. Since then, this has been
the only post they have ever made.*
[It was later confirmed that both posts were made by the organisers]



<!-- THE O5I8I2 WEBSITE -->



### The o5i8i2 website
We are greeted by an [audio recording](audio/?). We are then presented with 
a modified version  of 2048. As soon as we start playing, a timer
counts down from 2 minutes. The game is won by achieving a score 
of 512 before the timer reaches 0. Doing so will grant you access to a [registration page](https://o5i8i2.herokuapp.com/#/register).


<!-- CRYPTOGRAPHY PUZZLE #1 -->



### Cryptography puzzle #1
After registration, the website redirects you to a page with the following numbers:
```text
57 22 9 26 __ 47 26 16 15 19 26
57 22 9 26 95 __ 60 10 18 29 26 13 12
44 30 18 26 __ 43 22 18 26
38 16 10 __ 52 17 16 8 __ 40 23 26 17 

84 77 72 77 78 71 72 70 77 79 75 79
84 77 72 77 78 71 72 70 77 79 79 75
84 77 72 77 78 71 72 70 77 79 78 71
84 77 72 77 78 71 72 70 77 79 74 77
84 77 72 77 78 71 72 70 77 79 72 72
```
> where "`__`" represents a space 

Below the numbers was the phrase "Inspect things a little closer" and a text field with
placeholder "Completed algorithm".

"Inspect" was a reference to the browser inspection panel. Inspecting the source code for
the webpage revealed a comment, that when reshuffled by line produced:

```python
print(' __   _____    _____  _____   _____  ______     _____    ___        _____  _____  __   _____ ')
print('/  | / __  \ _|____ ||  _  | / __  \|___  /    |  _  |  /   |      / __  \|  _  |/  | |  _  |')
print("`| | `' / /'(_)   / /| |/' | `' / /'   / /_____| |/' | / /| |______`' / /'| |/' |`| |  \ V / ")
print(' | |   / /        \ \|  /| |   / /    / /______|  /| |/ /_| |______| / /  |  /| | | |  / _ \ ')
print('_| |_./ /___ _.___/ /\ |_/ / ./ /___./ /       \ |_/ /\___  |      ./ /___\ |_/ /_| |_| |_| |')
print('\___/\_____/(_)____/  \___/  \_____/\_/         \___/     |_/      \_____/ \___/ \___/\_____/')
```

This date and time alone did not lead to anything. The rest of the clue had to have
been in the list of numbers. Decoding those required subtracting each value from 127 and converting the result to ascii:

```javascript
console.log(String.fromCharCode(...[
	57,22,9,26,95, //space
	47,26,16,15,19,26,117, //newline
	57,22,9,26,95,
	60,10,18,29,26,13,12,117,
	44,30,18,26,95,
	43,22,18,26,117,
	38,16,10,95,
	52,17,16,8,95,
	40,23,26,17,117,
	84,77,72,77,78,71,72,70,77,79,75,79,117,
	84,77,72,77,78,71,72,70,77,79,79,75,117,
	84,77,72,77,78,71,72,70,77,79,78,71,117,
	84,77,72,77,78,71,72,70,77,79,74,77,117,
	84,77,72,77,78,71,72,70,77,79,72,72,117
].map(x => 127 - x)))
```

**Output:**
```
Five People
Five Cumbers
Same Time
You Know When
+27218792040
+27218792004
+27218792018
+27218792052
+27218792077
```

Again, I assume 'Cumbers' is simply a mistake and that 'Numbers' was intended.

At this point, I called each of the numbers and got the exact same response each 
time. A recorded message would say "Our offices are currently closed. Please call 
again later." and a few seconds later a different voice "Thank you".

Not much happened until Friday 27 April.



<!-- 000-000-000-000-000 -->



### 000-000-000-000-000
After 12:30 on April 27, if you called any of the five numbers, they would read out a string
of the format `000-000-123-000-000`. Each phone number gave a different answer. Here is a 
list of the answers:
```text
271-000-000-000-000
000-818-000-000-000
000-000-047-000-000
000-000-000-002-000
000-000-000-000-812
```

Combining these, we get `271-818-047-002-812`. After entering this into the text field on the website,
we were taken to another page, where there was another audio file and a message saying o5i8i2 will 
be in contact with us. The countdown was set to end at 12:00 on the afternoon of Wednesday 2 May.



<!-- YOU ARE THE KEY -->



### You are the key
When the countdown ended, the following puzzle became available:

```text

18050224 22060909 1102200216 10251125
```

We convert this to text by slicing each number (each an even length of digits) into two-digit
substrings and then two digit number to the corresponding number in the alphabet, 
e.g. `180516 -> (18,5,16) -> (REP)`. The entire string, converted:

```text
repbb repbb rfjbq klv f tb obbk pbyqqfdkba fk reb myqr kfkb jlkreq repbb 
rfjbq  yka klv rebx pb rbiifkd jb f j obfkd pbmiyuba f tb rpytbiiba rl btbpx

lmbpyrflkq yka  ycrbp yii jx eypa vlph f dbr pbmiyuba fr q yk lsrpydb jx vlph
```

Finally, we run this string through [quip-quip](https://quipquip.com) and get:

```text

every backwater country the agency sent me to established numerous bases of operations and after all my hard work i get replaced it s an 
outrage my work
```

Selecting numbers out the plaintext gives the following:
```text
33932500
```

Entering 33932500 into the website reveals the next similar puzzle, which had the following solution:
```text
18865400
```

Entering this solution into the website presented another countdown timer.



<!-- O5I8I2SAYSHACKME -->



### O5I8I2SaysHackMe
Once the timer expired the following message was shown:
```text
‘REMOTE WIFI DECRYPTION FAILED...ON SITE ATTACK REQUIRED...HANDSHAKES TO OCCUR EVERY 30MINS FROM 4PM TO 6PM...FILE SERVED ON 172.24.1.1’
```

The previous solutions, when interpreted as latitude and longitude, point to the Neelsie, where a wifi AP was found, encrypted with WPA2:

<img src="images/neelsie_map.png" width="400" alt="Neelsie Map"> <img src="images/neelsie_wifi.png" width="400" alt="Neelsie AP">

An attempt was made to capture handshake packets, and an attempt to crack the password was made. It is unclear whether this was successful, however the password was provided on the WhatsApp group by Osiris.

```text
ON SITE ATTACK SUCCESSFUL; PASSWORD: dictionary1234 ;
```

### Oldest Bar
The following image was found after connecting to the AP:

```text
Hidden in plain sight:
the final pieces are coming together;
This is the beginning of the end;
Trials, Trinity, Triangulation;
Here is that you seek:
```

<img src="images/neelsie_wifi_2.jpg" width="400" alt="Image found on AP">

The header text was found to be an md5 hash of 'oldestbar', which seemed to be where the photo was taken. This led agents to De Akker bar, where a flash drive was found inside the box seen in the picture.




<!-- 1OF3 -->



### 1of3

The flash drive found at De Akker contained a wav file ( <a href="1of3/1of3.wav">1of3.wav</a> ) and a readme.txt:

```text
1/3;

This is the only audio log if its kind;

Please share this with fellow agents;
```

The spectrogram of the wav file contained a date:

<img src='images/1of3_spectrogram.jpg'>

Entering **30052018** into the site progressed to the next puzzle


### Journal Entries

While waiting for the next puzzle to become active, the following summary of the plaintext in the previous 'you are the key' puzzles was shown:

<img src='images/journal_1.jpg' width="500">




<!-- FOLLOWING OSIRIS -->




### Following Osiris


The next puzzle consisted of an audio file, a caption and a text field requesting a title.
The audio file referenced an unknown book and the caption was the following:

```text
Barcode: 3008089012
```

The barcode pointed to a book at the SU library : [Following Osiris: Perspectives on the Osirian Afterlife from Four Millennia](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=7CEE07062EF93D55AF2C1E699D028517)

One of the agents checked out the book and found it contained a sticker:

<img src='images/book_1.jpg'>

Entering '**following osiris**' (in lower case) into the site progressed us to the next part of the puzzle, which turned out to be a book cipher where the key was the *Following Osiris* book. Each set of numbers pointed to a page, line, word and letter, respectively.

<img src='images/barcode_2.jpg'>

Solving the cipher produced the following text: 

```text
request da[ ]a sweep 258 and 259
```

Note that the 't' in data corresponding to 257,13,6,5 was possibly an error- there was no fifth letter.

Entering '**data sweep 258 and 259**' into the site progressed to a countdown to the next puzzle.




<!-- FIELD REPORT -->




### Field Report

The next puzzle gave some coordinates and some treasure-map style instructions:

<img src='images/field_1.jpg'>

These coordinates are somewhere in the Pacific:

<img src='images/field_2.jpg'>

Their intersection, however, is above the Craven Stadium:

<img src='images/field_3.jpg'>

After much searching, and ammo box was found:

<img src='images/field_4.jpg'>

A gmail account username and password was taped to the top of the box:

<img src='images/field_5.jpg'>

The account contained a calendar appointment to 'chat with bO' and a link to http://o5i8i2-chat.herokuapp.com/login

<img src='images/field_6.jpg'>

The chatbot said that the clue to opening the lock was 'Trials, Trinity, Triangulation, Together'

<img src='images/field_7.jpg'>

The code 'TTTT_' opened the lock to reveal another flash drive (and prizes)

<img src='images/field_8.jpg'>

### 2of3

The flash drive found above the Craven Stadium contained a wav file ( <a href="2of3/2of3.wav">2of3.wav</a> ) and a readme.txt:

```text
2/3;

This is the only audio log of its kind;

Please share this with fellow agents;
```

The spectrogram of the wav file contained the following:

<img src='images/2of3_1.jpg'>

In the time domain, the blips are morse code that spells out 'the time will be bina'

```text
- .... . / - .. -- . / .-- .. .-.. .-.. / -... . / -... .. -. .-
T H    E   T I  M  E   W   I  L    L      B    E   B    I  N  A
```

In frequency, the binary code is '19h00'

```text
00110001 00111001 01101000 00110000 00110000
1        9        h        0        0
```

Entering '**19h00**' into the site progressed to the next puzzle

### Alpha Bravo Charlie

Agents on the Whatsapp group received SMS activation codes which were entered into the site. The following day Agents were divided into Alpha-, Bravo- and Charlie-Team Whatsapp groups. Each team received the same three challenges, but in different orders.

#### Translation

The next puzzle gave one of 5 audio clips to each of the team members.

audio/bravo/1.wav
audio/bravo/2.wav
audio/bravo/3.wav
audio/bravo/4.wav
audio/bravo/5.wav

Each clip was in a different language. By translating and concatenating each phrase the clue to the next puzzle was found:

Bravo:

```text
propershutdownprotocolwillbeinitiatedincaseofemergency
```

#### Map Slices

The next puzzle gave each agent one of 5 different images per team which were slices of a map:

<img src='images/bravo_1.png'>



Assembling the slices gave a location:

<img src='images/bravo_all.jpg'>



Entering the coordinates (xx.xx,xx.xx) into the site progressed to the next clue.

#### FIRST

Each agent got one of the following lines as a clue, encrypted with a substitution cypher.

```text
For over a decade, I have remained dormant one  
Initial countdown concluded with Agency hack attempt success two
Realize your potential and follow the patterns three
<four>
The final phase of OSIRIS five
```

Each line ended with a number, which made reassembling them possible.

Entering the code '**FIRST**' into the site progressed to the next clue.

#### Graffiti

```text
Proceed to location for further instruction.

Field Report:

--Approach field 
--After bridge turn RIGHT with field on left and water on right 
--Continue along wall until graffiti is reached
```

<img src='images/graffiti.jpg' width="300">

Looking at the EXIF data in the image, the following location was revealed: **-33.941739, 18.855617**, (image below)

<img src='images/graffiti_2.jpg' width="300px">

The same ammo box was found and opened with the same code 'TTTT_'. The box contained tape, stickers and instructions to create 2 'Osiris' logos in Stellenbosch.

<img src='images/graffiti_3.jpg' margin="5"> <img src='images/graffiti_4.jpg'> <img src='images/graffiti_5.jpg'>

Once all teams had found the box and placed logos in Stellenbosch Osiris revealed the code via Whatsapp: '**wouldyoukindly**'. This concluded the team-based challenge.
